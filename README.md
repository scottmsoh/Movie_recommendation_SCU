# Movie_recommendation_SCU

- Developed a movie recommendation system using content-based and collaborative filtering (memory and model-based approaches).
- Employed machine learning for data cleaning, exploration, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Utilized algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for generating personalized movie recommendations.
- Addressed data biases and optimized the dataset for improved recommendation accuracy and performance.
- Planned future enhancements include session-based recommendations and exploring deep learning for nuanced user preferences.
- Aimed at enhancing user experience by providing tailored movie suggestions.
